# Key-Value Store Database

## Description

A simple key-value-store database. 
A prospective client could include client.h and client.cpp in their project 
to send messages over the internet to an instance of the server running. 

This project is currently very-incomplete, poorly documented, and  buggy.

## To add in the future:

Future features I hope to add include:

1. Server storing data persistently on harddrive using a b-tree or similar 
   data structure

2. The hasthable implementation used by the server is currently very 
   inefficient, I want to put some effort trying to write a faster 
   implementation
